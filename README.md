Android-ecommerce-project
=========================

Wrote this for a course I took. It pretends to launch a background service and notifications - Just belieable enough for a demo.


When you open this app it has a screen or two about what my fake app did for my course project.
It then claims to have started a background service (not true). Once you close the app,
it waits a short time (to be believeable) before displaying a notification (supposedly 
from the background service). Upon clicking the notification it launched another activity.

That's all!
